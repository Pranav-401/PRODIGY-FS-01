# Secure User Authentication
#OverView
  This project implements a secure authentication system using react.js , autho0 for authentication strategies. It allows users to register, 
  log in securely, and log out. This README provides an overview of the project, dependencies, and steps to recreate it.
#Features
  1.Universal Login: Centralized login experience across applications.
  2.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification (e.g., SMS, email, authentication apps).
  3.Single Sign-On (SSO): Supports logins through social media (e.g., Facebook, Google) and enterprise providers (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP).
  4.Passwordless Authentication:Users can log in using email or SMS without needing a password.
  5.Customizable Authentication Flows: Use Auth0 Rules and Hooks for custom logic.
  6.API Security: Protects APIs with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols.
